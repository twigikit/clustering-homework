# clustering-homework

This exercise uses some unsupervised machine learning techniques. It involves:

* Normalise data using the scikit-learn StandardScaler module. 
* Use the elbow method algorithm to find the best value for k using the Original Data
* Cluster the data with K-Means by using the original data
* Optimise the clusters with principal component analysis (PCA) where n-components = 3
* Find the best value for k by using the PCA data
* Cluster the data with K-Means by using the PCA data
* Visualise and compare the results
